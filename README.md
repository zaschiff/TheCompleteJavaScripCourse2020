## Section 2 - JS-Basics

Code pertaining to the very basics of coding in the JavaScript language. This covers all the basics from simple console output to the screen to higher level topics suchs as objects, methods, and function. This section has 5 coding challenges, each one is labeled. Each coding challenge files has the description of the challenge and my solution to the challenge underneath. If you would like to see Jonas' solution please look at _Schmedtmann Master Code > 2-JS-basics > final > script.js_ his solution is the commented out code.

ALSO PLEASE NOTE: Due to completeing another course on web development, I had node.js installed on my machines. I did not require the index.html file to see the output from my code like Jonas did. I ran these challenge scripts from the terminal using node.js which is why I have two scipt files, one tied to the index.html file and the rest are just stand alone js files. Should you wish to see the output of my solutions in the browser, simply change the __source file in the script tag of the html file__ to the chosen coding challenge file.
