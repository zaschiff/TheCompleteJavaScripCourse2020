## Section 2 - JS-Basics

Code pertaining to the very basics of coding in the JavaScript language. This covers all the basics from simple console output to the screen to higher level topics suchs as objects, methods, and function. This section has 5 coding challenges, each one is labeled. Each coding challenge files has the description of the challenge and my solution to the challenge underneath. If you would like to see Jonas' solution please look at _Schmedtmann Master Code > 2-JS-basics > final > script.js_ his solution is the commented out code.

ALSO PLEASE NOTE: Due to completeing another course on web development, I had node.js installed on my machines. I did not require the index.html file to see the output from my code like Jonas did. I ran these challenge scripts from the terminal using node.js which is why I have two scipt files, one tied to the index.html file and the rest are just stand alone js files. Should you wish to see the output of my solutions in the browser, simply change the __source file in the script tag of the html file__ to the chosen coding challenge file.

## Section 3 - How JavaScript works behind the scenes

This section was all note taking lectures. Very little coding work. There were noe coding challenges. Due to this ther is no folder for this section.

## Section 4 - DOM Manipulation and events

This section covers the manipulation of the DOM. We then use the information we have learned to build a game called the Pig game. It is a simple dice game. The Starting file only functions for one die. Where we must manipulate the DOM in according with the game rules. The coding challenges are then to add adidtionaly rules and features to the game. The starter code for the game can be found at _Schmedtmann Master Code > 4-DOM-pig-game > starter_. The finished code prior to the challenges can be found at _Schmedtmann Master Code > 4-DOM-pig-game > final > app.js_. The coding challenge solutions can be found at _Schmedtmann Master Code > 4-DOM-pig-game > final > challenges.js_. My copy is strictly my soluton to the coding challenges and does not look like the final code for the original game.

## Section 5 - Objects and Functions

This sections covers the essetials of object oriented programming within javascript. There is one coding challenge with in the section which makes us create a mini question game and keep the players score using privatized objects and functions.

## Section 6 - Budgety

This section covers the budget appt hat tries to tie together all the concepts taught thus far into a single application. This application has advanced dom manipulation, advanced privitization amongs it's methods and variables to create a well flushed application.

## Section 7 - ES6

This sections covers new features that were intriduced into JavaScript version ES6. This version si not supported in older browsers but is supported in many modern ones. This new syntax gives greater contorl and privitization with in the code to make it easier for the developer to work on creating their own stylized code. There is one coding challenge designed to utilize the stronger, newer syntax of ES6.
